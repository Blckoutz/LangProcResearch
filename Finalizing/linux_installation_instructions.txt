1. Install Python 3.7 or higher (Make sure to add Python to PATH during installation)
   - Use your package manager to install Python (e.g., apt for Ubuntu/Debian):
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

2. Install the required Python packages:
   - Open a terminal and run the following:
     pip install requests
     pip install transformers
     pip install torch
     pip install sentencepiece
     pip install tqdm

3. Install additional dependencies for transformers (if not installed already):
   - For running the script, you need to have both `torch` and `transformers` installed. If not installed, run the following:
     pip install torch
     pip install transformers

4. Verify installations:
   - To check if everything is installed correctly, run:
     python3 -c "import transformers; import torch; import requests; import sentencepiece"

5. Run the script:
   - Once the dependencies are installed, you can run your Python script as usual.

   TLDR, run this command for all the packages:
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers datasets tqdm requests lxml sentencepiece
